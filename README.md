## Section 1: Distributions

#### You are an Analyst working for a high-end clothes design boutique. 
#### The company is developing a new line of clothes for very tall people. Your team is analyzing the viability of the project from a sales perspective and your manager has asked you to assist with some input variables to help test the financial forecast.
#### You need to create two distributions:
- A normal distribution of 1000 observations for heights of men in the US
- A normal distribution of 1000 observations for heights of women in the US
#### Also, for each of the two populations, you have been asked to identify the minimum height of 2.2% of the tallest people in that population.
#### In the Unites States, men's height have a mean of 69.1 inches (175.5 cm) and standard deviation of 2.9 inches (7.4 cm) while female height's have a mean of 63.7 inches (161.8 cm) and a standard deviation of 2.7 inches (6.9 cm). 

## Section 2: Central limit Theorem Analytics Challenge:
#### You are a Business Analyst working for a logistics delivery company. 
#### A business client has requested a large freight to be transported urgently from Denver to Salt Lake City. When asked about the weight of the cargo, they could not supply the exact weight. However, they have specified that there are a total of 36 boxes.
#### From prior experience with this client, you know that this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean if u = 72 lbs (32.66 kg) and a standard deviation of s = 3 lbs (1.36 kg). 
#### The only plane you currently have at Denver is a Cessna 209B Grand Caravan with a max cargo weight of 2,630 lbs (1,193 kg).
#### Based on this information, what is the probability that all of the cargo can be safely loaded onto the plane and be transported?

### Part 2:
#### You are a Quantitative Analyst working for a Wall-Street investment fund.
#### The team of traders, under your supervision, earns profits which can be approximated with a Laplace distribution. Profits have a mean of $95.70 and a standard deviation of $1,247. Your team makes about 100 trades every week. 
#### Questions
- What is the probability of your team making a loss in any given week?
- What is the probability of your team making over $20,000 in any given week?
